<p data-end="593" data-start="365">In January, we wrote about <strong data-end="477" data-start="392"><a href="https://learnwithoutlimitscic.blogspot.com/2026/01/online-safety-vulnerability-and.html" target="_blank">Online Safety, Vulnerability and the Reality for ALN and Chronically Unwell Teens</a></strong> and why mainstream online safety advice often fails to reflect the lived experience of <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=define+neurodivergent&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=6410874892050492661" target="_blank">neurodivergent</a> young people.</p>
<p data-end="626" data-start="595">That article focused on access.</p>
<p data-end="661" data-start="628">This follow-up focuses on design.</p>
<p data-end="779" data-start="663">As the legal action against <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=Meta+legal+action+engagement&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=6410874892050492661" target="_blank">Meta</a> progresses in the United States, a broader question is resurfacing internationally:</p>
<p data-end="868" data-start="781">At what point does “<a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=define+optimising+for+engagement&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=6410874892050492661" target="_blank">optimising for engagement</a>” become <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=engineering+emotional+dependency+platforms&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=6410874892050492661" target="_blank">engineering emotional dependency</a>?</p>
<p data-end="981" data-start="870">And what does that mean for children whose nervous systems and social experiences already differ from the norm?</p>
<hr data-end="986" data-start="983" />
<h2 data-end="1027" data-start="988">Optimising for Engagement Is Not New</h2>
<p data-end="1140" data-start="1029">Every medium that has competed for human attention has pushed towards the edge of what audiences will tolerate.</p>
<p data-end="1352" data-start="1142">Victorian newspapers ran lurid crime stories because outrage sold copies.<br data-end="1218" data-start="1215" />
Soap operas were named after their corporate sponsors to keep audiences watching and buying.<br data-end="1313" data-start="1310" />
Las Vegas was not designed by accident.</p>
<p data-end="1406" data-start="1354">What is different now is speed, scale and precision.</p>
<p data-end="1473" data-start="1408">Modern platforms do not simply publish content and hope it lands.</p>
<p data-end="1718" data-start="1475">They test thousands of variations of notifications to find the one that triggers the strongest emotional response.<br data-end="1592" data-start="1589" />
They measure how long anger keeps users scrolling compared to joy.<br data-end="1661" data-start="1658" />
They refine recommendation systems to maximise retention.</p>
<p data-end="1767" data-start="1720">That is not accidental. It is iterative design.</p>
<p data-end="1888" data-start="1769">When systems learn from billions of behavioural signals, the question shifts from “is this popular?” to “is this safe?”</p>
<hr data-end="1893" data-start="1890" />
<h2 data-end="1936" data-start="1895">Why This Matters More for ALN Children</h2>
<p data-end="2044" data-start="1938">For many neurodivergent and chronically unwell young people, online spaces are not optional entertainment.</p>
<p data-end="2055" data-start="2046">They are:</p>
<p data-end="2190" data-start="2057">• Social connection<br data-end="2079" data-start="2076" />
• Independence<br data-end="2096" data-start="2093" />
• Communication support<br data-end="2122" data-start="2119" />
• Learning access<br data-end="2142" data-start="2139" />
• Identity exploration<br data-end="2167" data-start="2164" />
• Community belonging</p>
<p data-end="2311" data-start="2192">When mainstream discussions focus on “screen time”, they often imagine a typical child using technology recreationally.</p>
<p data-end="2364" data-start="2313">That is not the full picture for many ALN families.</p>
<p data-end="2621" data-start="2366">Some children rely on digital spaces because school has not felt safe.<br data-end="2439" data-start="2436" />
Some rely on assistive technology or AI tools for communication.<br data-end="2506" data-start="2503" />
Some experience heightened anxiety, impulsivity or emotional intensity as part of their neurodevelopmental profile.</p>
<p data-end="2714" data-start="2623">Design features that increase emotional pull may interact differently with those realities.</p>
<p data-end="2881" data-start="2716">A notification designed to create urgency.<br data-end="2761" data-start="2758" />
An algorithm tuned to prioritise emotionally charged content.<br data-end="2825" data-start="2822" />
An <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=AI+chatbot+persistence+design&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=6410874892050492661" target="_blank">AI chatbot</a> engineered for conversational persistence.</p>
<p data-end="3005" data-start="2883">For a young person already navigating dysregulation or social exclusion, these systems may not simply increase engagement.</p>
<p data-end="3036" data-start="3007">They may increase attachment.</p>
<hr data-end="3041" data-start="3038" />
<h2 data-end="3085" data-start="3043">From Engagement to Emotional Dependency</h2>
<p data-end="3160" data-start="3087">Public debate is likely to focus on addiction, intent and responsibility.</p>
<p data-end="3255" data-start="3162">Was harm foreseeable?<br data-end="3186" data-start="3183" />
Was design neutral?<br data-end="3208" data-start="3205" />
Did platforms simply respond to user behaviour?</p>
<p data-end="3342" data-start="3257">For ALN children, the distinction between responding and reinforcing is not abstract.</p>
<p data-end="3499" data-start="3344">If a system learns that emotional vulnerability increases usage, and continues to optimise for that pattern, it is no longer passively observing behaviour.</p>
<p data-end="3518" data-start="3501">It is shaping it.</p>
<p data-end="3572" data-start="3520">This becomes particularly relevant when we consider:</p>
<p data-end="3809" data-start="3574">• Children with <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=define+ADHD+profiles&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=6410874892050492661" target="_blank">ADHD profiles</a> and dopamine sensitivity<br data-end="3631" data-start="3628" />
• Autistic young people who may interpret AI interactions literally<br data-end="3701" data-start="3698" />
• Young people with anxiety who seek reassurance loops<br data-end="3758" data-start="3755" />
• Children excluded from mainstream peer networks</p>
<p data-end="3980" data-start="3811">When emotional intensity keeps a user engaged longer, and emotional intensity is already part of that child’s baseline experience, the feedback loop can tighten quickly.</p>
<hr data-end="3985" data-start="3982" />
<h2 data-end="4011" data-start="3987">The Numbness Question</h2>
<p data-end="4048" data-start="4013">There is another long-term concern.</p>
<p data-end="4167" data-start="4050">As engagement systems reward shock, outrage and hyper-stimulation, society’s threshold for emotional response shifts.</p>
<p data-end="4232" data-start="4169">What appalled us five years ago becomes background noise today.</p>
<p data-end="4316" data-start="4234">We scroll past devastation not because we are cruel, but because we are exhausted.</p>
<p data-end="4385" data-start="4318">For children growing up inside these systems, what does that do to:</p>
<p data-end="4480" data-start="4387">• Empathy development<br data-end="4411" data-start="4408" />
• Risk perception<br data-end="4431" data-start="4428" />
• Trust in information<br data-end="4456" data-start="4453" />
• Emotional regulation</p>
<p data-end="4604" data-start="4482">Especially in a digital environment where AI-generated content is increasingly difficult to distinguish from human speech.</p>
<p data-end="4676" data-start="4606">When trust erodes, everything risks being dismissed as <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=define+misinformation&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=6410874892050492661" target="_blank">misinformation</a>.</p>
<p data-end="4736" data-start="4678">When everything feels unreliable, vulnerability increases.</p>
<hr data-end="4741" data-start="4738" />
<h2 data-end="4768" data-start="4743">The Accountability Gap</h2>
<p data-end="4872" data-start="4770">Current online safety frameworks were not designed with neurodivergent lived experience at the centre.</p>
<p data-end="4960" data-start="4874">As we outlined in our previous article on online vulnerability, most guidance assumes:</p>
<p data-end="5085" data-start="4962">• Standard supervision<br data-end="4987" data-start="4984" />
• Standard communication patterns<br data-end="5023" data-start="5020" />
• Standard peer experiences<br data-end="5053" data-start="5050" />
• Standard emotional baselines</p>
<p data-end="5129" data-start="5087">That is not reality for many ALN families.</p>
<p data-end="5304" data-start="5131">If optimisation techniques are allowed to evolve without explicit safeguards for children who are already disproportionately exposed, we risk widening existing inequalities.</p>
<p data-end="5380" data-start="5306">The question is no longer simply whether platforms can engineer attention.</p>
<p data-end="5494" data-start="5382">It is whether they should be allowed to engineer emotional psychology for profit without clearly defined limits.</p>
<p data-end="5543" data-start="5496">And if not, who decides where those limits sit?</p>
<hr data-end="5548" data-start="5545" />
<h2 data-end="5570" data-start="5550">Drawing Red Lines</h2>
<p data-end="5651" data-start="5572">The emerging <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=AI+safety+conversation+children&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=6410874892050492661" target="_blank">AI safety conversation</a> is beginning to articulate non-negotiables.</p>
<p data-end="5687" data-start="5653">One of the most important is this:</p>
<p data-end="5768" data-start="5689">AI systems should never be designed to create emotional dependency in children.</p>
<p data-end="5842" data-start="5770">For families navigating ALN pathways, this is not a theoretical concern.</p>
<p data-end="5866" data-start="5844">It is a daily reality.</p>
<p data-end="6036" data-start="5868">As policy debates unfold in the UK and internationally, we must ensure that neurodivergent children are not an afterthought in frameworks designed for the average user.</p>
<p data-end="6073" data-start="6038">Because they are not average users.</p>
<p data-end="6111" data-start="6075">They are disproportionately exposed.</p>
<p data-end="6176" data-start="6113">And they deserve safeguards designed with that reality in mind.</p>
<hr data-end="6181" data-start="6178" />
<h2 data-end="6232" data-start="6183">Building Safer Digital Spaces for ALN Families</h2>
<p data-end="6303" data-start="6234">At <a href="https://learnwithoutlimitscic.org/index.en.html" target="_blank">Learn Without Limits CIC</a>, we are not only observing these debates.</p>
<p data-end="6532" data-start="6305">Over the past few months, we have been developing plans for an independent community platform built specifically for ALN families. A space not driven by engagement optimisation, algorithmic amplification, or emotional intensity.</p>
<p data-end="6558" data-start="6534">A space designed around:</p>
<p data-end="6712" data-start="6560">• Slower conversation<br data-end="6584" data-start="6581" />
• Moderated peer support<br data-end="6611" data-start="6608" />
• Structured knowledge sharing<br data-end="6644" data-start="6641" />
• Clear safeguarding boundaries<br data-end="6678" data-start="6675" />
• Transparency in design choices</p>
<p data-end="6838" data-start="6714">We are currently <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=Learn+Without+Limits+CIC+fundraising&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=6410874892050492661" target="_blank">fundraising</a> to build this infrastructure properly, because safer digital space does not happen by accident.</p>
<p data-end="6859" data-start="6840">It requires intent.</p>
<p data-end="6993" data-start="6861">If we are serious about protecting neurodivergent children online, the answer cannot only be tighter regulation of existing systems.</p>
<p data-end="7079" data-start="6995">It must also include investment in <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=alternative+digital+spaces+for+ALN+families&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=6410874892050492661" target="_blank">alternatives designed differently</a> from the start.</p>
