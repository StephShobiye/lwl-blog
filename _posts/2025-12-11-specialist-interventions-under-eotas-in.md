<p data-end="705" data-start="279">When a child cannot access education in a school setting, families often begin searching for <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=specialist+interventions+examples&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=5501950650975821880" target="_blank">specialist interventions</a> that might finally help. Parents want to know what exists, what works for their child, and what is actually available in <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=Wales&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=5501950650975821880" target="_blank">Wales</a>. Unfortunately, there is no single place where this information is explained clearly. Many organisations talk in general terms, but very few describe the real picture on the ground.</p>
<p data-end="967" data-start="707">This guide brings everything together in one place.<br data-end="761" data-start="758" />
It explains the specialist interventions used in Wales, who they suit, and how they differ. It is written for families, in plain language, and grounded in the lived experience of our <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=peer+support+community&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=5501950650975821880" target="_blank">peer support community</a>.</p>
<p data-end="1124" data-start="969">Later, in Part 2, we explain which interventions are state provided, which exist only in the private or charity sector, and which usually require <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=Tribunal+special+education+Wales&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=5501950650975821880" target="_blank">Tribunal</a>.</p>
<p data-end="1190" data-start="1126">For now, let us start by mapping out what is actually out there.</p>
<hr data-end="1195" data-start="1192" />
<h1 data-end="1251" data-start="1197">⭐ 1. Behaviour and communication based interventions</h1>
<p data-end="1606" data-start="1253">These interventions focus on <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=communication+social+connection+emotional+regulation+approaches+children&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=5501950650975821880" target="_blank">communication, social connection, emotional regulation</a> or behaviour that is linked to unmet need. Some are widely used in Wales. Some are rare. Some are only seen in specialist provision. The aim here is not to endorse or discourage any method, but to help parents understand what these approaches are and where they appear.</p>
<hr data-end="1611" data-start="1608" />
<h2 data-end="1641" data-start="1613">⭐ Intensive Interaction</h2>
<p data-end="1885" data-start="1642"><strong data-end="1657" data-start="1642">What it is:</strong><br data-end="1660" data-start="1657" />
A relationship based approach that supports very early communication and social connection. It is often used with children who have significant learning disabilities or are in the earliest stages of communication development.</p>
<p data-end="2013" data-start="1887"><strong data-end="1908" data-start="1887">Where it is used:</strong><br data-end="1911" data-start="1908" />
Common in specialist schools and <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=PMLD+settings&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=5501950650975821880" target="_blank">PMLD settings</a>.<br data-end="1961" data-start="1958" />
Rare in home based <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=EOTAS+education+Wales&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=5501950650975821880" target="_blank">EOTAS</a> unless Tribunal directs it.</p>
<p data-end="2157" data-start="2015"><strong data-end="2032" data-start="2015">Who it suits:</strong><br data-end="2035" data-start="2032" />
Children who communicate mainly through facial expression, sound, gesture or shared attention rather than spoken language.</p>
<hr data-end="2162" data-start="2159" />
<h2 data-end="2186" data-start="2164">⭐ The 5P Approach</h2>
<p data-end="2415" data-start="2187">Developed by <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=Linda+Miller+autism&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=5501950650975821880" target="_blank">Linda Miller</a>, this approach focuses on understanding thinking patterns, predictability, planning and problem solving for autistic children and young people who experience rigid thinking or struggle with transitions.</p>
<p data-end="2566" data-start="2417"><strong data-end="2438" data-start="2417">Where it is used:</strong><br data-end="2441" data-start="2438" />
Occasionally recommended by educational psychologists.<br data-end="2498" data-start="2495" />
Not widely commissioned, but respected by practitioners who know it.</p>
<p data-end="2684" data-start="2568"><strong data-end="2585" data-start="2568">Who it suits:</strong><br data-end="2588" data-start="2585" />
Children who become distressed or stuck when routines change or when required to think flexibly.</p>
<hr data-end="2689" data-start="2686" />
<h2 data-end="2704" data-start="2691">⭐ SCERTS</h2>
<p data-end="2877" data-start="2705"><a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=define+SCERTS&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=5501950650975821880" target="_blank">SCERTS</a> stands for Social Communication, Emotional Regulation and Transactional Support. It is a framework often used in specialist schools and sometimes referenced in IDPs.</p>
<p data-end="3008" data-start="2879"><strong data-end="2900" data-start="2879">Where it is used:</strong><br data-end="2903" data-start="2900" />
Specialist schools and <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=autism+bases+schools&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=5501950650975821880" target="_blank">autism bases</a>.<br data-end="2942" data-start="2939" />
Rare in home tuition unless a specialist practitioner is involved.</p>
<p data-end="3120" data-start="3010"><strong data-end="3027" data-start="3010">Who it suits:</strong><br data-end="3030" data-start="3027" />
Autistic children who need structured support with communication and emotional regulation.</p>
<hr data-end="3125" data-start="3122" />
<h2 data-end="3160" data-start="3127">⭐ Positive Behaviour Support</h2>
<p data-end="3307" data-start="3161">A practical and person centred approach that focuses on understanding the reasons behind behaviour and reducing distress by addressing unmet need.</p>
<p data-end="3452" data-start="3309"><strong data-end="3330" data-start="3309">Where it is used:</strong><br data-end="3333" data-start="3330" />
Used in some specialist provisions and sometimes brought into EOTAS packages for children with complex behaviour needs.</p>
<p data-end="3560" data-start="3454"><strong data-end="3471" data-start="3454">Who it suits:</strong><br data-end="3474" data-start="3471" />
Children whose behaviour communicates discomfort, sensory overload, fear or confusion.</p>
<hr data-end="3565" data-start="3562" />
<h2 data-end="3618" data-start="3567">⭐ Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS)</h2>
<p data-end="3698" data-start="3619">A structured visual system that supports communication without spoken language.</p>
<p data-end="3788" data-start="3700"><strong data-end="3721" data-start="3700">Where it is used:</strong><br data-end="3724" data-start="3721" />
Specialist settings and sometimes EOTAS when tutors are trained.</p>
<p data-end="3857" data-start="3790"><strong data-end="3807" data-start="3790">Who it suits:</strong><br data-end="3810" data-start="3807" />
Children who benefit from visual communication.</p>
<hr data-end="3862" data-start="3859" />
<h2 data-end="3903" data-start="3864">⭐ Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA)</h2>
<p data-end="4034" data-start="3904"><a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=Applied+Behavior+Analysis+autism+controversy&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=5501950650975821880" target="_blank">ABA</a> attempts to change behaviour through structured teaching. It focuses heavily on reinforcement and measurable behaviour change.</p>
<p data-end="4339" data-start="4036"><strong data-end="4058" data-start="4036">Important context:</strong><br data-end="4061" data-start="4058" />
The autistic adult community in Wales and across the UK campaigned strongly for ABA not to be adopted in national guidance. Concerns include masking, compliance training, potential emotional harm and the pressure to appear neurotypical rather than supporting genuine well being.</p>
<p data-end="4465" data-start="4341"><strong data-end="4362" data-start="4341">Where it is used:</strong><br data-end="4365" data-start="4362" />

Tribunal ordered only in exceptional cases with extensive expert evidence.</p>
<p data-end="4571" data-start="4467"><strong data-end="4484" data-start="4467">Who it suits:</strong><br data-end="4487" data-start="4484" />
A very small number of children.<br data-end="4522" data-start="4519" />
Families seeking ABA usually access it privately.</p>
<hr data-end="4576" data-start="4573" />
<h2 data-end="4616" data-start="4578">⭐ Social communication programmes</h2>
<p data-end="4758" data-start="4617">These include social skills groups, friendship groups and communication coaching. They vary widely in quality depending on who delivers them.</p>
<p data-end="4907" data-start="4760"><strong data-end="4784" data-start="4760">Where they are used:</strong><br data-end="4787" data-start="4784" />
Some are offered by schools.<br data-end="4818" data-start="4815" />
Some are included in alternative provision.<br data-end="4864" data-start="4861" />
Many are run by private therapists or CICs.</p>
<p data-end="5009" data-start="4909"><strong data-end="4927" data-start="4909">Who they suit:</strong><br data-end="4930" data-start="4927" />
Children who want support with connection, communication or peer relationships.</p>
<hr data-end="5014" data-start="5011" />
<h1 data-end="5068" data-start="5016">⭐ 2. Less common or parent requested interventions</h1>
<p data-end="5274" data-start="5070">Parents often hear about approaches used in the United States or in other countries. Some of these are not part of the Welsh system, but families ask about them often, so we include them here for clarity.</p>
<hr data-end="5279" data-start="5276" />
<h2 data-end="5301" data-start="5281">⭐ DIR Floortime</h2>
<p data-end="5389" data-start="5302">A play based developmental approach that focuses on relationships and emotional growth.</p>
<p data-end="5471" data-start="5391"><strong data-end="5412" data-start="5391">Where it is used:</strong><br data-end="5415" data-start="5412" />
Very rare in Wales.<br data-end="5437" data-start="5434" />
Usually only accessible privately.</p>
<hr data-end="5476" data-start="5473" />
<h2 data-end="5493" data-start="5478">⭐ Son Rise</h2>
<p data-end="5556" data-start="5494">A home based programme centred around intensive play sessions.</p>
<p data-end="5681" data-start="5558"><strong data-end="5579" data-start="5558">Where it is used:</strong><br data-end="5582" data-start="5579" />
Not commissioned by Welsh Government or Local Authorities.<br data-end="5643" data-start="5640" />
Available only through private routes.</p>
<hr data-end="5686" data-start="5683" />
<h2 data-end="5720" data-start="5688">⭐ Pivotal Response Training</h2>
<p data-end="5790" data-start="5721">A behavioural method linked to ABA, used mainly in the United States.</p>
<p data-end="5852" data-start="5792"><strong data-end="5813" data-start="5792">Where it is used:</strong><br data-end="5816" data-start="5813" />
Not routinely commissioned in Wales.</p>
<hr data-end="5857" data-start="5854" />
<h2 data-end="5888" data-start="5859">⭐ Rapid Prompting Method</h2>
<p data-end="5969" data-start="5889">A controversial communication method that is not endorsed by educational bodies.</p>
<p data-end="6019" data-start="5971"><strong data-end="5992" data-start="5971">Where it is used:</strong><br data-end="5995" data-start="5992" />
Almost entirely private.</p>
<hr data-end="6024" data-start="6021" />
<p data-end="6130" data-start="6026">These approaches may appear in online discussion, but they are not typical components of EOTAS in Wales.<br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p><h3 data-end="376" data-start="315"><strong data-end="376" data-start="319"><span style="font-size: x-large;">Section 2: Therapeutic and Health Based Interventions</span></strong></h3><p data-end="673" data-start="378">Not all children who need EOTAS require intensive therapy, but many do need support that goes beyond academic teaching.
