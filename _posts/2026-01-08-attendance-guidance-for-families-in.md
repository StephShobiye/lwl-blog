What is often missing from these conversations is a basic but crucial point:</p><p data-end="1218" data-start="1164"><strong data-end="1218" data-start="1164">Attendance law does not override a child’s health.</strong></p><p data-end="1397" data-start="1220"><span class="hover:entity-accent entity-underline inline cursor-pointer align-baseline">Welsh Government</span> guidance is clear that where health affects attendance, the response should be supportive, flexible and planned. It should not be punitive.</p><p data-end="1573" data-start="1399">This article explains what parents are expected to do, what they are not required to do, and how families can push back safely when pressure is being applied inappropriately.</p><hr data-end="1578" data-start="1575" /><h2 data-end="1646" data-start="1580">Do parents need a doctor’s note every time a child is off sick?</h2><p data-end="1655" data-start="1648"><strong data-end="1655" data-start="1648">No.</strong></p><p data-end="1767" data-start="1657">There is no requirement in Wales for parents to obtain a GP or medical note for every illness related absence.</p><p data-end="2076" data-start="1769">Welsh Government attendance definitions confirm that illness is an authorised absence where a satisfactory explanation has been provided by the parent. GP practices are not expected to provide letters for routine sickness, and parents are not required to seek medical appointments purely to justify absence.</p><p data-end="2164" data-start="2078">Medical evidence can take many forms and GP notes are <strong data-end="2139" data-start="2132">not</strong> the default expectation.</p><p data-end="2400" data-start="2166"><strong data-end="2180" data-start="2166">Key point:</strong> Schools should not require medical evidence as a condition of authorising absence where illness is genuine and explained. If a school intends to mark illness as unauthorised, it should tell parents this and explain why.</p><p data-end="2431" data-start="2402"><strong data-end="2431" data-start="2402">Suggested parent wording:</strong></p><blockquote data-end="2630" data-start="2433"><p data-end="2630" data-start="2435">“Please record today’s absence as illness. I am providing a satisfactory explanation. If you intend to mark this as unauthorised, please confirm in writing and explain what evidence you require.”</p></blockquote><hr data-end="2635" data-start="2632" /><h2 data-end="2698" data-start="2637">What about fluctuating conditions and sporadic attendance?</h2><p data-end="2798" data-start="2700">Many children live with health conditions that do not follow a predictable pattern. This includes:</p><ul data-end="2946" data-start="2800"><li data-end="2839" data-start="2800"><p data-end="2839" data-start="2802">chronic fatigue and pain conditions</p></li><li data-end="2870" data-start="2840"><p data-end="2870" data-start="2842">mental health difficulties</p></li><li data-end="2901" data-start="2871"><p data-end="2901" data-start="2873">neurodevelopmental burnout</p></li><li data-end="2946" data-start="2902"><p data-end="2946" data-start="2904">post-viral illness, including Long Covid</p></li></ul><p data-end="3224" data-start="2948">Welsh Government guidance on supporting learners with healthcare needs exists specifically because some learners cannot reliably access education in the usual way. It recognises that health conditions may fluctuate, worsen after activity, and affect attendance inconsistently.</p><p data-end="3237" data-start="3226">This means:</p><ul data-end="3395" data-start="3239"><li data-end="3299" data-start="3239"><p data-end="3299" data-start="3241">a child coping one week does not prove capacity the next</p></li><li data-end="3346" data-start="3300"><p data-end="3346" data-start="3302">uneven attendance does not equal avoidance</p></li><li data-end="3395" data-start="3347"><p data-end="3395" data-start="3349">pressure to push through can worsen outcomes</p></li></ul><p data-end="3512" data-start="3397">Attendance affected by healthcare needs should trigger planning and flexibility, not assumptions of non-compliance.</p><p data-end="3543" data-start="3514"><strong data-end="3543" data-start="3514">Suggested parent wording:</strong></p><blockquote data-end="3716" data-start="3545"><p data-end="3716" data-start="3547">“Our child has healthcare needs that affect capacity. We are asking for a planned approach to access and support, not assumptions based on short periods of improvement.”</p></blockquote><hr data-end="3721" data-start="3718" /><h2 data-end="3787" data-start="3723">Is there a percentage absence rate that triggers enforcement?</h2><p data-end="3884" data-start="3789">There is <strong data-end="3832" data-start="3798">no legal attendance percentage</strong> at which fines or court action automatically apply.</p><p data-end="4121" data-start="3886">In practice, attendance below 90 percent is often labelled persistent absence. This is a <strong data-end="3998" data-start="3975">monitoring category</strong>, not an enforcement threshold. It is used to identify learners who may need additional support, not to mandate punishment.</p><p data-end="4234" data-start="4123">Attendance figures must always be interpreted in context, particularly where illness or disability is involved.</p><hr data-end="4239" data-start="4236" /><h2 data-end="4308" data-start="4241">What is the role of the school nurse and why are they important?</h2><p data-end="4470" data-start="4310">School nurses in Wales are Specialist Community Public Health Nurses working under the Healthy Child Wales Programme. Their role is not limited to vaccinations.</p><p data-end="4637" data-start="4472">They support physical and emotional health, identify barriers to education, work with families and schools, and contribute to planning where health affects learning.</p><p data-end="4729" data-start="4639">They are one of the few professionals whose remit explicitly bridges health and education.</p><p data-end="4790" data-start="4731">School nurse involvement can be particularly valuable when:</p><ul data-end="4995" data-start="4792"><li data-end="4828" data-start="4792"><p data-end="4828" data-start="4794">attendance is affected by health</p></li><li data-end="4874" data-start="4829"><p data-end="4874" data-start="4831">conditions fluctuate or are misunderstood</p></li><li data-end="4921" data-start="4875"><p data-end="4921" data-start="4877">schools focus solely on attendance figures</p></li><li data-end="4995" data-start="4922"><p data-end="4995" data-start="4924">families are being pressured without health being properly considered</p></li></ul><p data-end="5075" data-start="4997">Parents do <strong data-end="5015" data-start="5008">not</strong> need school permission to request school nurse involvement.</p><p data-end="5106" data-start="5077"><strong data-end="5106" data-start="5077">Suggested parent wording:</strong></p><blockquote data-end="5300" data-start="5108"><p data-end="5300" data-start="5110">“I am requesting input from the school nursing service, as Welsh Government describes school nursing as assessing and monitoring health needs and working with families to promote wellbeing.”</p></blockquote><p data-end="672" data-start="358">The school nurse is also very useful where a child requires ongoing healthcare support. They can help draw up an <strong data-end="509" data-start="471">Individual Health Care Plan (IHCP/IHP)</strong> to support chronic healthcare needs while a child is attending school. This can include continence support, medication, or other day-to-day health requirements.</p><p>

Parents are entitled to request that healthcare needs are considered before escalation.</p><p data-end="5726" data-start="5623">Parents can also request communication in writing and ask for meetings to include health professionals.</p><p data-end="5757" data-start="5728"><strong data-end="5757" data-start="5728">Suggested parent wording:</strong></p><blockquote data-end="5950" data-start="5759"><p data-end="5950" data-start="5761">“Our child’s absences relate to healthcare needs. Before any enforcement action is considered, please confirm what support and planning steps have been taken to ensure access to education.”</p></blockquote><hr data-end="5955" data-start="5952" /><h2 data-end="6008" data-start="5957">Penalty notices and enforcement as a last resort</h2><p data-end="6234" data-start="6010">Penalty notices exist, but Welsh Government guidance frames them as <strong data-end="6120" data-start="6078">one option among several interventions</strong>. Decision-makers are expected to have regard to the guidance and follow it unless there is good reason to depart.</p><p data-end="6374" data-start="6236">This reinforces an important principle: enforcement should not be the first response, particularly where health needs are clearly in play.</p><hr data-end="6379" data-start="6376" /><h2 data-end="6436" data-start="6381">Being encouraged to deregister because of attendance</h2><p data-end="6572" data-start="6438">Some families report being advised that deregistration would “solve” attendance problems where a child is too unwell to attend school.</p><p data-end="6602" data-start="6574">It is important to be clear:</p><p data-end="6714" data-start="6604"><strong data-end="6644" data-start="6604">Deregistration is a parental choice.</strong><br data-end="6647" data-start="6644" />It should not be presented as a response to health related absence.</p><p data-end="6846" data-start="6716">Welsh Government guidance is built around access, planning and working together. Families are entitled to expect consideration of:</p><ul data-end="6999" data-start="6848"><li data-end="6870" data-start="6848"><p data-end="6870" data-start="6850">authorised absence</p></li><li data-end="6903" data-start="6871"><p data-end="6903" data-start="6873">healthcare informed planning</p></li><li data-end="6930" data-start="6904"><p data-end="6930" data-start="6906">reasonable adjustments</p></li><li data-end="6999" data-start="6931"><p data-end="6999" data-start="6933">alternative provision where attendance is not currently suitable</p></li></ul><p data-end="7030" data-start="7001"><strong data-end="7030" data-start="7001">Suggested parent wording:</strong></p><blockquote data-end="7204" data-start="7032"><p data-end="7204" data-start="7034">“We are not seeking deregistration. We are asking how education can be accessed appropriately while healthcare needs are managed, in line with Welsh Government guidance.”</p></blockquote><hr data-end="7209" data-start="7206" /><h2 data-end="7246" data-start="7211">When does EOTAS become relevant?</h2><p data-end="7316" data-start="7248">Education Otherwise Than At School (EOTAS) may be appropriate where:</p><ul data-end="7477" data-start="7318"><li data-end="7375" data-start="7318"><p data-end="7375" data-start="7320">a child cannot reasonably attend school due to health</p></li><li data-end="7423" data-start="7376"><p data-end="7423" data-start="7378">attendance pressure worsens their condition</p></li><li data-end="7477" data-start="7424"><p data-end="7477" data-start="7426">school-based adjustments have not resolved access</p></li></ul><p data-end="7539" data-start="7479">EOTAS is a lawful education route, not a failure by parents.</p><p data-end="7597" data-start="7541">If you need more information about EOTAS and whether it might be applicable to your situtation, then part 1 of our 5-part EOTAS series can be found here<i>:-&nbsp;<a href="https://learnwithoutlimitscic.blogspot.com/2025/12/eotas-in-wales-part-1.html">https://learnwithoutlimitscic.blogspot.com/2025/12/eotas-in-wales-part-1.html</a></i></p><hr data-end="7602" data-start="7599" /><h2 data-end="7659" data-start="7604">What Welsh Government guidance consistently supports</h2><p data-end="7770" data-start="7661">Across attendance guidance, healthcare needs frameworks and school nursing policy, the message is consistent:</p><ul data-end="7941" data-start="7772"><li data-end="7812" data-start="7772"><p data-end="7812" data-start="7774">illness can be an authorised absence</p></li><li data-end="7858" data-start="7813"><p data-end="7858" data-start="7815">attendance must be interpreted in context</p></li><li data-end="7897" data-start="7859"><p data-end="7897" data-start="7861">support should precede enforcement</p></li><li data-end="7941" data-start="7898"><p data-end="7941" data-start="7900">health and education must work together</p></li></ul><p data-end="8030" data-start="7943">Parents are <strong data-end="7962" data-start="7955">not</strong> expected to compromise a child’s health to meet attendance targets.</p><hr data-end="8035" data-start="8032" /><h2 data-end="8075" data-start="8037">If you are reading this as a parent</h2><p data-end="8157" data-start="8077">If you are exhausted, frightened or feeling pressured, please hear this clearly:</p><p data-end="8238" data-start="8159"><strong data-end="8238" data-start="8159">Protecting your child’s health is responsible parenting.
