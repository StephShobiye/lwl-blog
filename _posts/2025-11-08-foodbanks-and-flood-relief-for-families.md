<h2 data-end="1003" data-start="950">The Emotional and Practical Impact on ALN Families</h2>
<p data-end="1530" data-start="1005">When floods strike, the <strong data-end="1064" data-start="1029">emotional and logistical impact</strong> on families with disabled or ALN children can be intense. Many parents have described the experience of scrambling to evacuate as water levels rose – leaving behind essential items like medications, sensory toys, communication devices, or mobility aids. Routines that children rely on were instantly upended. This can trigger distress, meltdowns, or anxiety, especially for autistic children or those with developmental disabilities who struggle with sudden change.</p>

<p data-end="2153" data-start="1534"><strong data-end="1557" data-start="1534">Emotional Distress:</strong> It’s normal for children (and parents) to feel scared and disoriented after a flood. Kids may have nightmares, clinginess, or outbursts. Keep offering reassurance and simple explanations of what’s happening. Try to maintain <strong data-end="1803" data-start="1782">familiar routines</strong> (mealtimes, bedtime rituals) even in a new setting, as much as possible. If a favorite blanket or toy was rescued, encourage your child to use it for comfort.

Pembrokeshire County Council, for example, opened a leisure centre in Haverfordwest during previous storms and coordinates with Carmarthenshire if families evacuate across borders. In Swansea, the Liberty Stadium was used as a welcome centre during one flood event. The key message: <strong data-end="17174" data-start="17123">help is available, but you need to get in touch</strong> and let them know you need a safe place to stay. Don’t feel you’re bothering anyone – providing shelter in crises is a core part of the councils’ emergency response.</p>

<p data-end="17887" data-start="17344"><strong data-end="17376" data-start="17344">Staying with Family/Friends:</strong> Many ALN families choose to stay with relatives or friends after evacuating, to be in a more comfortable environment for their child. This is a great short-term solution if you have that support network. Still, inform the council of your situation – you may be eligible for financial help or cleaning services, and you should register as a flood victim in case your home needs inspection. Also, if your friend’s place gets overcrowded or unsuitable, you can always ask for a move to official temporary housing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-end="18293" data-start="17889">In any accommodation, remember to <strong data-end="17956" data-start="17923">prioritize your child’s needs</strong>. If you’re in a shared shelter, use the tips above for sensory/dietary needs. If in a hotel or friend’s home, try to create a small personal space for your child with their familiar items, and keep to your normal routine (e.g. homework or bedtime story) to provide a sense of security. This stability amid chaos is crucial for our kids.</p>
<p data-end="18923" data-start="18295">Finally, keep a note of any extra costs you incur while displaced (receipts for petrol, takeaway meals if you can’t cook, laundrette costs, etc.). These might be reimbursable via grants or insurance later. The situation is temporary – with each day, floodwaters recede and recovery picks up pace.

<h2 data-end="18982" data-start="18925">Special Considerations for ALN Children in Emergencies</h2>
<p data-end="19218" data-start="18984">Every family’s needs are different, and ALN families often face additional challenges during a crisis. Here are some <strong data-end="19138" data-start="19101">practical tips and considerations</strong> to help you support your child with additional needs during the flood recovery:</p>
<ul data-end="25246" data-start="19220">
<li data-end="20017" data-start="19220">
<p data-end="20017" data-start="19222"><strong data-end="19258" data-start="19222">Communication and Understanding:</strong> Children with communication difficulties (non-verbal, autism, etc.) might not understand <em data-end="19353" data-start="19348">why</em> all this is happening. Use whatever communication method works for them – simple words, pictures, Makaton signs, or a social story – to explain the flood in a calm way. For example: “<strong data-end="19655" data-start="19537">Rain made water come in our house. We will sleep somewhere else for a little while. Mum and Dad will keep you safe</strong>.” Reassure them that they have done nothing wrong. If your child uses a communication device or PECs cards, try to keep those accessible. If their AAC device (like an iPad with a talker app) was lost or water-damaged, ask the school or local ALN team if they have a spare or demo unit you could borrow; many education authorities have lending libraries for AAC.</p>
</li>
<li data-end="20952" data-start="20019">
<p data-end="20952" data-start="20021"><strong data-end="20039" data-start="20021">Sensory Needs:</strong> As mentioned, floods bring loud noises (thunder, sirens, generators), strange smells (mud, cleaning chemicals), and visuals (debris, unfamiliar environments) that can overwhelm a child with sensory sensitivities. Prioritize sensory comforts: headphones/ear defenders for noise, a mask or scarf with a familiar scent to cope with smell, favorite textures (a soft toy or blanket) for touch. In any temporary living situation, <em data-end="20491" data-start="20464">set up a “sensory corner”</em> if possible – a small area with their favorite items or sensory tools (stress ball, chew, fidget, etc.). This gives them a retreat when overstimulated. If your child has a sensory diet or routine (like bouncing on a ball, stretching, etc.), try to maintain those activities daily. Many of us have learned creative ways to improvise sensory activities – jumping exercises or pillow forts can help release energy when outdoor play is limited by flood conditions.</p>
</li>
<li data-end="22130" data-start="20954">
<p data-end="22130" data-start="20956"><strong data-end="20980" data-start="20956">Diet and Medication:</strong> Adhering to special diets under crisis conditions is hard, but not impossible. Let relief providers know: for example, if your child has <strong data-end="21154" data-start="21118"><a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=gluten+free+food+allergies+emergency+help&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=7792436739390791054" target="_blank">celiac disease or food allergies</a></strong>, clearly communicate that <em data-end="21220" data-start="21181">“my child cannot have foods with ___”</em>. Foodbank volunteers can often swap items (e.g. rice instead of pasta, non-dairy milk if needed). For tube-fed children, contact your community nurse; deliveries of supplies can be rerouted to your new location. If refrigeration is an issue for medications or certain foods, mention this to shelter staff – they might have a fridge you can use. <strong data-end="21604" data-start="21566">Do not wait on medication refills.</strong> If you’re running low on any essential meds (seizure meds, insulin, inhalers, etc.), call a GP or 111 immediately to arrange pickup at a nearby pharmacy. Pharmacies in Wales can dispense an emergency 5-day supply of many medications without a prescription in a pinch – just explain it’s an emergency due to flooding. Also, if your child is on the autism pathway or CAMHS and missing any sessions or treatments due to the flood, inform those providers; they can often reschedule or provide guidance remotely to bridge the gap.</p>

Try to incorporate a bit of <strong data-end="22466" data-start="22434">educational play or learning</strong> each day in a low-pressure way – read a favorite book, do a little counting while stacking cans, etc. It’s not about formal academics now, but maintaining a sense of normalcy. If your child has an IDP (Individual Development Plan) or IEP, some goals might not be workable at the moment – and that’s okay. Jot down any significant behaviors or regressions you notice (for example, if your child has more anxiety or has lost a skill during this upheaval) so you can discuss them with teachers or therapists later.

Reward brave or calm behavior with praise or small treats. If your child has a meltdown or aggressive episode (which can happen when they’re overwhelmed), ensure everyone’s safety but try to understand it as communication of distress. You might also be dealing with your own stress, so consider reaching out to mental health support for yourself if needed (GPs can refer you for counseling or check if local charities offer parent support groups in the aftermath).</p>

For instance, have them be in charge of holding the torch while you check the car, or sorting clean clothes into piles. It provides a sense of control. For children who like water play, oddly enough, helping with some safe cleanup (like drying plastic toys that got wet) might be therapeutic – but never force it if they’re afraid.</p>

Most people want to help and appreciate understanding the <strong data-end="25554" data-start="25541">inclusive</strong> steps that make a big difference for your family.

While their main role is usually helping with education plans and rights, they are very understanding of crisis situations and can guide you if, say, you’re worried the school won’t understand why your child’s behavior regressed, or if you need help communicating new needs for your child.

During this flood recovery, you can use the app’s note-taking or diary features to <strong data-end="29558" data-start="29512">document what your family is going through</strong>. Why is this important? Because as life normalizes, you’ll likely have meetings to update your child’s IDP (Individual Development Plan, the Welsh ALN support plan) or even their EHCP (Education Health and Care Plan, if you’re under an English authority or one of the rare cross-border cases). Having a record of the challenges your child faced – for example, increased anxiety, loss of equipment, breaks in therapy – will help ensure that <strong data-end="30028" data-start="29999">inclusive education plans</strong> reflect these needs. You might note, for instance, “Missed 2 weeks of speech therapy due to flood – speech regressed” or “Sensory issues heightened after trauma – requires extra calming strategies at school.” The app can store these securely, and also offers template language you might use when writing to the school or local authority about extra support. It’s like having a personal advocate in your pocket, reminding you of your rights under the ALN Act and offering tips on next steps. (If you don’t have the app, a simple notebook or phone notes app works too – the key is to jot things down now while fresh.)</p>
<p data-end="31113" data-start="30649">Additionally, <strong data-end="30691" data-start="30663">Learn Without Limits CIC</strong> and similar groups often liaise with government and councils after major events. By sharing your experiences (either in the app or via the Facebook group), you contribute to a collective voice that can improve disaster response for ALN families. This aligns with the broader mission of <em data-end="31008" data-start="30978">inclusive education in Wales</em> – making sure <strong data-end="31038" data-start="31023">every child</strong>, regardless of needs, is supported in school even after disruptive events.</p>

<p data-end="31735" data-start="31117"><strong data-end="31152" data-start="31117">Peer Support &amp; “Buddy” Systems:</strong> Sometimes what you need is one go-to person. If you have a fellow SEN parent friend or a support worker, don’t be afraid to lean on them. The ALN community is tight-knit. I’ve heard of families who connected online and ended up meeting for playdates so their kids could be around others who understand. The <strong data-end="31499" data-start="31460"><a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=Learn+Without+Limits+Facebook+group&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=7792436739390791054" target="_blank">Learn Without Limits Facebook group</a></strong> might help you find a nearby ALN family – maybe you can share childcare or just have a cup of tea together while the kids play, giving each other a break.

<p data-end="32140" data-start="31737">Finally, keep an eye on the <strong data-end="31815" data-start="31765">Learn Without Limits CIC (Wales) Facebook page</strong> and your local council’s social media for <strong data-end="31879" data-start="31858">real-time updates</strong>. For example, updates on which roads have reopened, announcements of any donated furniture schemes, or free events for kids (some play centres in Llanelli offered free sessions for flood-affected kids to have a bit of fun – these pop up on social media feeds).</p>
<h2 data-end="32197" data-start="32142">Planning Ahead: From Crisis to Recovery in Education</h2>
<p data-end="32447" data-start="32199">As immediate pressures start to ease, your thoughts may turn to the future. How will this flood impact your child’s education and support going forward? The Welsh ALN system is designed to be responsive, so here are a few <strong data-end="32446" data-start="32421">forward-looking steps</strong>:</p>
<ul data-end="35987" data-start="32449">
<li data-end="33202" data-start="32449">
<p data-end="33202" data-start="32451"><strong data-end="32487" data-start="32451">Inform the School/LA in Writing:</strong> It’s a good idea to <strong data-end="32539" data-start="32508">write a short note or email</strong> to your child’s school and/or the local authority’s ALN department outlining what has happened and any new needs. Even if you spoke to them already, having it in writing ensures it’s noted in their file. For example: <em data-end="33001" data-start="32757">“Just to inform you, our home was flooded on 5 Nov. This has caused disruption to [Child’s Name]’s routine and he lost some of his specialist equipment (e.g., sensory swing). We anticipate he may need extra support settling back into school.”</em> This alerts the school that they might need to deploy ELSA (emotional support) sessions or allow the child to, say, bring a comfort item to class. It also sets the stage for possibly updating the IDP.</p>
</li>
<li data-end="34285" data-start="33204">
<p data-end="34285" data-start="33206"><strong data-end="33235" data-start="33206"><a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=IDP+EHCP+review+process&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=7792436739390791054" target="_blank">Use Your IDP/EHCP Review</a>:</strong> If your child has an IDP (Wales) or EHCP (England), use the next review meeting to discuss the flood’s impact. You can request an earlier review if the situation has caused significant change in needs – this is a right you have if circumstances change. Bring the notes you’ve been keeping (via the app or notebook). For instance, if your child’s anxiety has spiked and they are refusing to get on the school bus now (perhaps because they fear leaving home), ask for support such as some counseling or a temporary door-to-door transport arrangement. If equipment was lost, the IDP could note that new equipment is needed (and the LA might need to fund it if insurance/DAF didn’t). Think of this as <strong data-end="33952" data-start="33933">future-proofing</strong> your child’s plan: by documenting now, you ensure the “system” recognizes the flood as a legitimate disruption that might require, say, extra learning support or therapy to catch up on missed progress. This is part of maintaining truly <strong data-end="34212" data-start="34189">inclusive education</strong> – schools adapting to the child’s situation, not penalizing them for it.</p>
</li>
<li data-end="34760" data-start="34287">
<p data-end="34760" data-start="34289"><strong data-end="34314" data-start="34289">Contingency Planning:</strong> Discuss with the school how they can help if such emergencies happen again. Many families will be pushing for better <strong data-end="34463" data-start="34432"><a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=emergency+contingency+plans+for+families&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=7792436739390791054" target="_blank">emergency contingency plans</a></strong> – e.g., having grab-and-go bags at school for children with medical needs, or a communication tree among ALN families. Your input can help shape these. Perhaps the school can create a “safe space” for discussions where kids can share their flood stories through art or play, which can be healing.</p>
</li>
<li data-end="35453" data-start="34762">
<p data-end="35453" data-start="34764"><strong data-end="34777" data-start="34764">Advocacy:</strong> If you feel your family’s needs are not being met, don’t hesitate to reach out to advocates (SNAP Cymru, your local councillors, or parent forums). The floods are a known issue, and there’s a lot of goodwill in authorities to make things right. For example, an MS (Member of Senedd) has already called for more support for Carmarthenshire flood victims and noted many lacked insurance<span data-state="closed">pembrokeshire-herald.com</span><span data-state="closed">pembrokeshire-herald.com</span> – so decision-makers are aware and watching. If you encounter red tape (like trouble getting the council grant or school transport issues), bring it up with those who can escalate it. You <strong data-end="35452" data-start="35429">deserve to be heard</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li data-end="35987" data-start="35455">
<p data-end="35987" data-start="35457"><strong data-end="35478" data-start="35457">Take Care of You:</strong> Lastly, planning ahead includes planning for <em data-end="35530" data-start="35524">your</em> well-being. Surviving a flood with a disabled child is a tremendous feat. Once the adrenaline fades, you might feel exhaustion or emotions catching up. That’s normal. Seek support for yourself – whether it’s a carers’ support group in your area, a coffee with a friend, or even short-term counseling (Wales has services like Team Around the Family or Carer’s Trust that offer listening support). A resilient parent is the best asset for a child’s recovery.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-end="36473" data-start="35989">Every small step you take – from joining a support group, to applying for a grant, to telling your story – is part of moving from crisis to recovery. <strong data-end="36171" data-start="36139">Inclusive education in Wales</strong> means our systems adapt to each child’s context, and you are ensuring your child’s context is understood. In time, this experience can even become a learning opportunity: schools might incorporate flood safety into lessons, or your child might build resilience and empathy from having gone through it.</p>

<p data-end="37079" data-start="36519">This journey is undoubtedly challenging, but you are not walking it alone. The <strong data-end="36623" data-start="36598">floods have tested us</strong>, yet they have also highlighted the strength and kindness in our communities.

<p data-end="38039" data-start="37513">Most importantly, hold onto hope. Your child will learn that even when their world gets turned upside down, it can be put right again with love and support.
