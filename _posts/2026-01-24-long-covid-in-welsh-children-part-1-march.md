It is recognised in children and young people. Symptoms can be physical, emotional or cognitive and they often fluctuate.

It is not a lack of resilience.<br data-end="1898" data-start="1895" />

They should adapt expectations, provide rest breaks and work collaboratively with families.</p><p data-end="6039" data-start="5944">Attendance pressure does not improve a health condition.

Here is the clearest explanation.</p><h3 data-end="6302" data-start="6272"><strong data-end="6302" data-start="6276">6.1 Reduced timetables</strong></h3><p data-end="6480" data-start="6304">A reduced timetable means the child attends school for fewer hours or fewer subjects.<br data-end="6392" data-start="6389" />
It is intended to be a short term plan to support recovery.<br data-end="6454" data-start="6451" />

If a school tells you they are offering flexi schooling, sometimes they actually mean a reduced timetable.<br data-end="6683" data-start="6680" />
These two arrangements are very different.</p><h3 data-end="6771" data-start="6727"><strong data-end="6771" data-start="6731">6.3 What flexi schooling actually is</strong></h3><p data-end="6995" data-start="6773">Flexi schooling is a formal agreement between the school and the parent which allows part of the education to take place at home.<br data-end="6905" data-start="6902" />
This can work well for children with Long Covid because it builds in rest days and pacing.<i><a href="https://learnwithoutlimitscic.blogspot.com/2025/12/flexi-schooling-in-wales-complete-guide.html">https://learnwithoutlimitscic.blogspot.com/2025/12/flexi-schooling-in-wales-complete-guide.html</a></i></p><hr data-end="7055" data-start="7052" /><h1 data-end="7131" data-start="7057"><strong data-end="7131" data-start="7059">7.
