The Education Act 1996 (Section 7) states that parents must ensure their child receives an "efficient full-time education suitable to their age, ability and any ALN, either by regular attendance at school or otherwise." For many families, home education is a proactive, philosophical choice. For others, it becomes the only viable option when a school cannot meet a child’s needs. This guide walks you through the legal process of deregistration in Wales and offers practical advice tailored to families of children with Additional Learning Needs (ALN).</p><hr /><h3>Mainstream vs Special School: Why It Matters</h3><p>First, confirm whether your child attends a <strong>mainstream school</strong> or a <strong><a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=maintained+special+school+Wales&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=1438653586681525796" target="_blank">maintained special school</a></strong>. The process differs significantly:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mainstream School</strong>: You can deregister independently with a letter to the headteacher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Special School</strong>: You must obtain permission from the local authority (LA) before deregistration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>You can confirm your child’s school type by contacting the LA or searching on <a href="https://www.estyn.gov.wales/find-a-provider">Estyn’s provider list</a>.</p><hr /><h2>Step-by-Step: Deregistering from a Mainstream School</h2><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Write to the Headteacher</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Clearly state your child’s name, DOB, and your decision to take full responsibility for their education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request that they be removed from the admissions register under <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=Regulation+8%281%29%28d%29+Education+Pupil+Registration+Wales+Regulations&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=1438653586681525796" target="_blank">Regulation 8(1)(d) of the Education (Pupil Registration) (Wales) Regulations</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask for confirmation in writing of the removal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Follow Up</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Schools must remove your child from the register promptly and notify the LA within 10 school days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they delay or refuse, politely remind them of their legal obligation and provide a copy of the regulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep a copy of the letter and request written confirmation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol><hr /><h2>If Your Child Attends a Special School</h2><p>In this case, the process requires <strong>formal consent</strong> from the LA.</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Contact Your LA’s ALN Department</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Explain your intent to home educate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request a meeting or written guidance on next steps.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Consent in Writing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The special school cannot remove your child from the roll without this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proceed with School Notification</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once consent is granted, send written notification to the school.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol><hr /><h2>🔄 Before You Deregister an ALN Child: What to Consider</h2><h3>1. Speak to NHS Therapists Early</h3><p>If your child receives:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Speech and Language Therapy (SaLT)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Occupational Therapy (OT)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=Physiotherapy&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=1438653586681525796" target="_blank">Physiotherapy</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>…contact therapists <strong>before</strong> deregistering to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Plan how therapy will continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss whether you’ll be delivering it at home as a parent-TA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask if peer social programmes can be recreated through local EHE groups.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>💡 <em>Therapists are unlikely to deliver support directly as they would in school due to caseloads. Most expect you to take the lead, with occasional clinic reviews. Typically, therapists may offer a written programme with reviews once per term or as resources allow. Ensuring that therapy handovers are clearly documented helps maintain safeguarding oversight.</em></p><h3>2. Plan for Equipment &amp; Accessibility</h3><p>School-based support may have included:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=Standing+frames+images&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=1438653586681525796" target="_blank">Standing frames</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=Communication+devices+for+children&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=1438653586681525796" target="_blank">Communication devices</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=Specialist+seating+software+for+children&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=1438653586681525796" target="_blank">Specialist seating or software</a></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Find out what’s available through <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=community+equipment+loans+Wales&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=1438653586681525796" target="_blank">community equipment loans</a> or what you may need to fund privately.</p><h3>3. Contact the School Nursing Service</h3><p><a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=school+nurses+role+in+home+education+wales&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=1438653586681525796" target="_blank">School nurses</a> remain an important contact point for:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>CAMHS referrals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neurodevelopmental assessments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ongoing health needs</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Let them know you're deregistering so they can update your child’s care plan and remain a support link. It’s a good idea to request a <strong>named contact</strong> within the school nursing service to ensure smoother communication over time. You may also wish to request a care plan review prior to deregistration if your child’s needs are complex.</p><p>💬 <em>Think of the school nurse service for EHE families like a health visitor for over-5s — they can offer valuable health input and signpost to additional support.</em></p><h3>4. Revisit the IDP and Review Plans</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>Who will now lead the annual review?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What outcomes need adjusting post-school?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use your app or records to show what’s working.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The LA will usually take over responsibility for the IDP. Make sure outcomes reflect the new learning environment.</p><p>If your child is subject to a safeguarding or child protection plan, ensure that the change in provision is shared with the relevant professionals to maintain oversight and prevent gaps in care.</p><h3>5. Peer Interaction Planning</h3><p>Home education doesn’t mean isolation. Children with ALN may need structured peer interaction. Local groups, co-ops, or therapist-led play/social groups can help. Ask therapists or other EHE parents for support finding or forming these networks.</p><p>💬 <em>It’s important to remain alert to signs of emotional withdrawal, loneliness, or distress. Reduced peer access can affect wellbeing and may signal safeguarding concerns over time.</em></p><h3>6. Understand That EHE Groups Are Unregulated</h3><p>Local home education groups and meet-ups are typically run by volunteers. These groups:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Are not subject to formal regulation or oversight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not require DBS checks for organisers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operate on a peer-led trust basis</p>
</li>
</ul><p>As a parent, <strong>you are responsible</strong> for supervising your child during meet-ups. You’ll usually be expected to remain on the premises and provide direct supervision. While these spaces can be warm and welcoming, families of ALN children, who may be more vulnerable, should exercise care and ask questions about safeguarding arrangements.</p><h3>7. Request School Records</h3><p>Get copies of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Behaviour plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support logs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk assessments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALN strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safeguarding or child protection notes, if relevant</p>
</li>
</ul><p>💡 <em>Schools are required to share this information under GDPR. You may wish to make a formal written request if needed.</em></p><p>These records are essential for continuity, safeguarding, and any future applications or transitions back into formal education.</p><hr /><h2>Support for Families Feeling Forced into EHE</h2><p><a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=Learn+Without+Limits+CIC&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=1438653586681525796" target="_blank">Learn Without Limits CIC</a> recognises that not all families choose home education willingly.
