They may feel <em data-end="382" data-start="372">left out</em> or jealous that their sibling gets more attention, or <em data-end="445" data-start="437">guilty</em> and confused as they watch their family struggle. In fact, researchers note that siblings “may not fully understand what is happening… They may feel guilty… or feel like they aren’t as important”<span data-state="closed"><span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]" data-testid="webpage-citation-pill"><a alt="https://childmind.org/article/5-ways-to-support-siblings-of-kids-with-mental-health-disorders/#:~:text=Dr,%E2%80%9D" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[9px] font-medium transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]!" href="https://childmind.org/article/5-ways-to-support-siblings-of-kids-with-mental-health-disorders/#:~:text=Dr,%E2%80%9D" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center">childmind.org</span></a></span></span>.  It helps to talk openly: encourage the well sibling to ask questions and express their worries. Reassure them that their feelings are valid. Schedule one-on-one time with each child so the healthy sibling knows they are loved <em data-end="925" data-start="907">for who they are</em>, not just as a carer or playmate. Affirm that neither of them caused the situation – ALN is just how their sibling’s brain works, and not anyone’s fault.</p>
<p data-end="1935" data-start="1083"><strong data-end="1107" data-start="1083">Support and Balance.</strong>  Siblings who also act as carers need extra care themselves. A young carer should never be overloaded with adult responsibilities. Give them breaks from chores: let them be a child (homework, playdates, hobbies) without feeling guilty. Involve them in caregiving <em data-end="1377" data-start="1371">only</em> with their consent and ability. For example, a teen might help by entertaining a younger ALN sibling for short periods. But always check they’re comfortable – and provide supervision or respite activities through <em data-end="1614" data-start="1591"><a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=young+carers+services&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=2264628647178808719" target="_blank">young carers services</a></em> so they aren’t alone coping.

This alerts medical staff to their role and may trigger extra support (like annual flu jabs or referral to local services).</p>
<p data-end="2661" data-start="1937"><strong data-end="1969" data-start="1937">Explaining Diagnoses Kindly.</strong>  When telling siblings about an ALN diagnosis, use clear, gentle language. You don’t need clinical jargon; focus on behaviors and feelings. For example, “Your sister has autism – her brain sees and feels things differently. Sometimes she gets upset or needs quiet time, and that’s why things can be hard for her”<span data-state="closed"><span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]" data-testid="webpage-citation-pill"><a alt="https://childmind.org/article/5-ways-to-support-siblings-of-kids-with-mental-health-disorders/#:~:text=Parents%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20use,do%20things%20she%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20otherwise" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[9px] font-medium transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]!" href="https://childmind.org/article/5-ways-to-support-siblings-of-kids-with-mental-health-disorders/#:~:text=Parents%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20use,do%20things%20she%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20otherwise" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center">childmind.org</span></a></span></span>. Framing it simply (e.g. “he just needs extra help with…” or “her body feels overwhelmed sometimes”) helps children understand without fear. Emphasize that the diagnosis isn’t their sibling’s fault and doesn’t change how much they’re loved. Offer books or stories about other children with similar needs if the sibling is old enough to read.</p>
<p data-end="3370" data-start="2663"><strong data-end="2696" data-start="2663">Coping with Guilt or Anxiety.</strong>  Siblings may experience “survivor’s guilt” – feeling envious or asking <em data-end="2790" data-start="2769">“why them, not me?”</em> Reassure them that every child has some challenges; it’s just that their siblings are more visible. Give plenty of praise and attention to the well sibling’s own achievements. Remind them that they, too, deserve care and happiness. Keeping routines and family traditions (like special outings or meals together) can reinforce that each child is equally important. If they express guilt or anger, listen empathetically and consider <a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=sibling+support+groups&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=2264628647178808719" target="_blank">sibling support groups</a> (many areas have <strong data-end="3282" data-start="3263"><a data-preview="" href="https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&amp;q=Sibling+Support+sessions&amp;bbid=6470633950786405900&amp;bpid=2264628647178808719" target="_blank">Sibling Support</a></strong> sessions or short breaks so brothers and sisters can meet peers in similar situations).</p>

Encourage hobbies or clubs outside caring: maybe your non-ALN child can have a subsidized place in Guides/Scouts, sports, music, etc. Check if there’s a short-breaks scheme or funding for the family – many Welsh local authorities offer grants or trips for siblings of disabled kids. Finally, remind siblings that caring is kind but it’s okay to say “I need help too” – their needs matter.</p>
