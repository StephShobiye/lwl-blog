Despite over 20 years of the Welsh Government adopting the social model of disability, “too many people with impairments face barriers to the world of work” (Welsh Government, 2021). Wales continues to hold the highest disability employment gap in Britain, currently around 30 percentage points (StatsWales, 2023). In real terms, this means many disabled youth (ages 16–30) cycle through government-funded schemes with very little to show for it.</p><h3>Outcome Failures: What the Data Tells Us</h3><p>The UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)’s flagship Work Programme (2011–2017) and successor Work and Health Programme (WHP) both undershot their targets for disabled jobseekers. Under the Work Programme in Wales, only 1 in 4 disabled participants achieved a sustained job outcome (DWP Work Programme statistics, 2016). A Parliamentary report concluded the programme was “particularly failing... the hardest-to-help,” with clear evidence of creaming and parking — prioritising “easy wins” while sidelining those with greater barriers (House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, 2014).</p><p>Under the WHP, the results remained bleak: over 80% of disabled participants did not secure a sustained job, and only 31% were in work after two years (DWP WHP Evaluation, 2023).</p><p>The Restart Scheme, a 12-month DWP programme for long-term unemployed people run by contractors like Maximus, has fared no better. As of late 2024, fewer than 1 in 4 participants have entered paid employment (National Audit Office, 2024). Despite billions in investment, outcomes remain deeply disappointing for disabled jobseekers.</p><h3>Systemic Gaps and Fragmentation in Wales</h3><p>Employment policy is split between UK and Welsh governments, often leading to confusion, duplication, and poor follow-through. A Welsh Government evaluation in 2022 acknowledged that the employability landscape was “fragmented and changeable,” with service users bounced between DWP programmes, Working Wales, college employability teams, and local authority support, often with little continuity or coordination (WG Evaluation of Employability Provision, 2022).</p><p>For example, a young person might be referred by the Jobcentre to a UK-wide scheme like Restart (Maximus), only to be redirected weeks later to Working Wales, or vice versa, with no transfer of knowledge or tailored action planning.</p><blockquote><p>“I’ve had five action plans in three years and not one person has helped me apply for a single job. It’s all form-filling and ticking boxes.”</p></blockquote><h3>A Closer Look at the Providers</h3><ul data-spread="true"><li><p>Maximus and Remploy are the largest DWP contractors in Wales, running Restart, WHP, and Intensive Personalised Employment Support (IPES). They have been repeatedly criticised in Parliament and the media for putting profits over people (The Guardian, 2023). Staff have spoken out about being pressured to log meetings and “tick activity boxes” rather than provide meaningful support (The Canary, 2022).</p></li><li><p>Working Wales, run by Careers Wales and funded by the Welsh Government, was designed to act as a “one-stop shop” for employability support. However, an independent evaluation found that disabled people are underrepresented among its service users, and many local delivery partners lack the specialist expertise to support high-needs individuals (WG Working Wales Evaluation, 2022).</p></li><li><p>Specialist programmes like Engage to Change and Elite Supported Employment show better results, with real work placements, supported internships, and employer mentoring. However, they are postcode-dependent, short-term funded, and not scaled to meet demand.</p></li></ul><h3>Demand-Side Failures: Employers and Adjustments</h3><p>A major missing piece across all programmes is meaningful employer engagement. Even the best schemes struggle to place participants because employers are often reluctant to adapt recruitment processes or offer flexible roles. Engage to Change’s ambassador noted that “employers aren’t giving us a chance” — echoing dozens of reports from participants who have done everything asked of them and still remain unemployed.</p><p>This is a demand-side failure, not a lack of effort from disabled candidates, but a lack of opportunity.</p><p>Employers should also be aware that hiring disabled people can improve loyalty and retention, reduce absenteeism, and foster inclusive work cultures, benefits that make inclusion a win-win.</p><div contenteditable="false"><hr /></div><h3>Note on Conditionality and Optional Support</h3><p>Not all jobseekers are subject to the same conditions. For example, those in the Limited Capability for Work and Work-Related Activity (LCWRA) group are not expected to look for work, but many still want support on a voluntary basis. This toolkit can help them navigate those conversations too.</p><p>We also recommend that you <strong>record your SMART goals and requests in writing</strong>&nbsp;- not just for personal tracking, but as useful documentation in case of future disputes or escalation. It helps ensure everyone is on the same page.<br /><br />___________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br /><br /></p><h2 data-end="220" data-start="140"><strong data-end="220" data-start="143">Section 2: Using SMART Targets to Take Control of Your Employment Support</strong></h2><p data-end="566" data-start="222">If you had an <strong data-end="273" data-start="236">IDP (Individual Development Plan)</strong> at school or college as part of the ALN system in Wales, you’ve likely come across <strong data-end="374" data-start="357">SMART targets</strong> before.
