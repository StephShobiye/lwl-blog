<h2 data-end="424" data-start="386">Introduction: something has shifted</h2>
<p data-end="548" data-start="426">Twenty years ago, volunteering in the UK rested on a relatively stable foundation.<br data-end="511" data-start="508" />
Today, that foundation has fractured.</p>
<p data-end="723" data-start="550">Across the third sector, organisations are reporting declining volunteer numbers, shorter commitments, higher burnout, and increasing reliance on a shrinking pool of people.</p>
<p data-end="866" data-start="725">This is not because people care less.<br data-end="765" data-start="762" />
It is because the conditions that once made large-scale, unpaid volunteering possible no longer exist.</p>
<hr data-end="871" data-start="868" />
<h2 data-end="916" data-start="873">The myth of the “endless volunteer pool.”</h2>
<p data-end="1054" data-start="918">Much of the third sector was built on the assumption that there would always be people with surplus time, energy and financial security.</p>
<p data-end="1213" data-start="1056">Historically, this often meant early retirees with defined-benefit pensions, stay-at-home spouses, and a relatively stable middle class with disposable time.</p>
<p data-end="1257" data-start="1215">That demographic has changed dramatically.</p>
<p data-end="1535" data-start="1259">People are now retiring later, or not at all. Many are caring for elderly parents because social care is under-resourced. Others are supporting adult children through university, housing, and childcare, while juggling paid work with unpaid caring responsibilities of their own.</p>
<p data-end="1603" data-start="1537">The pool that once sustained volunteering has structurally shrunk.</p>
<hr data-end="1608" data-start="1605" />
<h2 data-end="1669" data-start="1610">Austerity did not just cut services, it offloaded labour</h2>
<p data-end="1782" data-start="1671">From the early 2010s onwards, reductions in public spending did not remove the need.<br data-end="1754" data-start="1751" />
They shifted responsibility.</p>
<p data-end="1901" data-start="1784">Gaps left by the state were increasingly filled by volunteers, unpaid carers, community groups, and informal networks.</p>
<p data-end="1970" data-start="1903">Volunteering quietly became a load-bearing rather than supplementary activity.</p>
<p data-end="2109" data-start="1972">Food banks are the clearest example. Once an emergency response, they are now a normalised infrastructure, largely staffed by unpaid labour.</p>
<p data-end="2182" data-start="2111">When emergency responses become permanent, goodwill is slowly consumed.</p>
<hr data-end="2187" data-start="2184" />
<h2 data-end="2236" data-start="2189">Rising demand and collapsing unpaid capacity</h2>
<p data-end="2323" data-start="2238">At the same time as unpaid capacity has shrunk, demand for support has risen sharply.</p>
<p data-end="2581" data-start="2325">This has been driven by a shrinking middle class, widening inequality, rising housing and living costs, stretched education, health, and social care systems, and increasing complexity of need, including ALN/SEND, disability, mental health, and long-term illness.</p>
<p data-end="2685" data-start="2583">Support is no longer occasional or light touch.<br data-end="2633" data-start="2630" />
It is ongoing, intensive, and emotionally demanding.</p>
<p data-end="2722" data-start="2687">The result is a structural squeeze.</p>
<p data-end="2820" data-start="2724">More people need support for longer, while fewer people have the capacity to provide it unpaid.</p>
<hr data-end="2825" data-start="2822" />
<h2 data-end="2880" data-start="2827">Why better volunteer recruitment is not the answer</h2>
<p data-end="3017" data-start="2882">Many organisations respond to volunteer shortages by investing in recruitment campaigns, reframing messaging, or appealing to altruism.</p>
<p data-end="3049" data-start="3019">This misdiagnoses the problem.</p>
<p data-end="3204" data-start="3051">People are not unwilling to help. They are exhausted, financially stretched, and already carrying significant unpaid responsibilities in their own lives.</p>
<p data-end="3282" data-start="3206">Choosing to stay at home and recover is not apathy.<br data-end="3260" data-start="3257" />
It is self-protection.</p>
<p data-end="3416" data-start="3284">This is especially true for carers, disabled people, and neurodivergent people, the very groups most relied upon by the third sector.</p>
<hr data-end="3421" data-start="3418" />
<h2 data-end="3500" data-start="3423">The uncomfortable truth: volunteering can no longer replace infrastructure</h2>
<p data-end="3565" data-start="3502">The third sector now faces a difficult but necessary reckoning.</p>
<p data-end="3652" data-start="3567">Volunteering works best when it adds value, builds connections, and enhances services.</p>
<p data-end="3802" data-start="3654">It breaks down when it replaces paid roles, carries safeguarding or delivery risk, props up underfunded systems, or relies on guilt and obligation.</p>
<p data-end="3901" data-start="3804">The economic and social conditions that once supported large-scale unpaid labour no longer exist.</p>
<p data-end="4007" data-start="3903">Continuing to design services as if they do leads to burnout, churn, and sudden organisational collapse.</p>
<hr data-end="4012" data-start="4009" />
<h2 data-end="4043" data-start="4014">What adaptation looks like</h2>
<p data-end="4330" data-start="4045">Organisations that remain viable over the next decade will be those that build paid core capacity, design volunteering as bounded and optional, recognise contribution formally, reduce reliance on goodwill to hold risk, and use digital infrastructure to scale without exhausting people.</p>
<p data-end="4412" data-start="4332">This is not a retreat from community.<br data-end="4372" data-start="4369" />
It is a community redesigned for scarcity.</p>
<hr data-end="4417" data-start="4414" />
<h2 data-end="4445" data-start="4419">A different way forward</h2>
<p data-end="4519" data-start="4447">Acknowledging these structural shifts is not pessimism.<br data-end="4505" data-start="4502" />
It is realism.</p>
<p data-end="4654" data-start="4521">The future of volunteering is not about asking people to give more.<br data-end="4591" data-start="4588" />
It is about asking less, more clearly, and valuing it properly.</p>
<p data-end="4726" data-start="4656">Only then can volunteering remain meaningful, ethical, and sustainable.</p>
<hr data-end="4731" data-start="4728" />
<h3 data-end="4749" data-start="4733">Closing line</h3>
